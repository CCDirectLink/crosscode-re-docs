Everywhere.

# Format

For English-only mods, the format is as follows:

```
{
 "en_US": <English text, such as "Hello">,
 "langUid": <A number used on CrossCode's external sites. You should set this to something obviously wrong, such as: 13371337>
}
```

To add support for other languages, add their country codes as keys and the translated text as values.
